Every entity on the system will have 3 files:

    - Name              Main Class where determine the object 
                        //OBS: this is like my "Model" but I kwon the concept of model is other. oops! ;P

    - NameController    Controls the acess of DB, search things and anything more...
                        He do NOT suppost to print anything. //obs: oh boy this will be hard.
                        
    - NameView          Print things, working with macro View, but its suppost to help the macro View...
                        So macro View will call him when he need to something that already are done by NameView
